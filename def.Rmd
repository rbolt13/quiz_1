Before hopping into our proof, lets look at a few definitions with some [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/geometry) images. 

## Vertical Angles 

In class we defined vertical angles as being "across from each other". 

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "40%", fig.align='left', fig.cap='**Fig. 1: ** Vertical angles are shown in pink.'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/img1.png")
```

We can see a simple example of this in **Fig. 1** where a pair of pink angles $\angle AOB$ and $\angle COD$ are vertical to each other. 

Note that $\angle AOC$ and $\angle BOD$ are vertical angles as well.

## Congruence 

$x\cong y$ if there is an $\underline{\text{isometry}}$ that superimposes x onto y. 

- Isometry is a map that preserves distance and angles 

  - translation (move without turning)
  
  - rotation (moving about a fixed point)
  
  - reflection (mirror)
  
  - combination 

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "40%", fig.align='left', fig.cap='**Fig. 2: ** Two congruent triangles'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/img3.png")
```

In **Fig. 2** we see the two triangles are congruent, and would only need a translation isometry or two to map $\triangle ABC$ onto $\triangle A_1B_1C_1$. 

## Supplementary Angles 

We defined supplementary angles as angles whose measurement adds up to $180^\circ$.

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "40%", fig.align='left', fig.cap='**Fig. 3: **Supplementary angles are shown in pink and orange.'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/img2.png")
```

 In **Fig.3** we can clearly see that $m\angle AOC$ shown in pink and $m\angle AOB$ in orange adds to a straight line or $180^\circ$. We can also see three other pairs of supplementary angles: 

- $m\angle AOB+m\angle BOD=180^\circ$

- $m\angle BOD+m\angle COD=180^\circ$

- $m\angle COD+m\angle AOC=180^\circ$
